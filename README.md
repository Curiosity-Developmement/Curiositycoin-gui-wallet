## Development Setup (All Platforms)

### Dependencies

#### You will need the following dependencies installed before you can proceed to the "Setup" step:

- Node.JS (Latest LTS version - 10.x) https://nodejs.org/

- Yarn https://yarnpkg.com/en/

- Git https://git-scm.com/downloads

Tip: If you already have a different version of node.js installed besides 10.x, try using [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#install--update-script).

#### Setup

Install the dependencies with yarn.

```bash
$ cd curiositycoin-desktop-wallet
$ yarn
```

Run the wallet.

```bash
$ yarn start
```

### Starting Development

Start the app in the `dev` environment. This starts the renderer process in [**hot-module-replacement**](https://webpack.js.org/guides/hmr-react/) mode and starts a webpack dev server that sends hot updates to the renderer process:

```bash
$ yarn dev
```

### Packaging

To package apps for the local platform:

```bash
$ yarn package
```
